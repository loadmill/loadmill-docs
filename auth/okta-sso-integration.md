# Okta SSO integration

Okta is an identity and access management service platform that allows to secure every identity, from customers to the workforce with Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-factor Authentication and more.&#x20;

The Okta SSO integration with Loadmill enables Okta users to authenticate through Okta and then log into Loadmill without authenticating again.

### Configuration

**Requirements**

* Install the Loadmill application in your Okta instance
* Complete the steps below to set everything up

**Configuration steps**

After installing the application, you need to obtain some information that you will have to send to Loadmill

#### Gather information from Okta:

In the Okta admin page, click on the Loadmill application and then navigate to the General tab. Copy the following values:

* Client Id
* Client secret (click the eye button to toggle the visibility)
* Okta domain

**Send the information to Loadmill**

Once you have all the information (summarized below), email it to support@loadmill.com **:**

* Client Id
* Client Name (how you wish this team to be called - i.e. 'The Rebel Alliance')
* Client secret (click the eye button to toggle the visibility)
* Okta domain
* Company email suffix (i.e. my-comany.com)

Loadmill support will handle your request and get back to you once the integration is configured.

#### Note

Loadmill - Okta SSO integration is limited to one email suffix per integration. Meaning that if, for example, your email is [jon@snow.com](mailto:jon@snow.com) and the email suffix you supplied to us was [snow.com](mailto:jon@snow.com) then this organization integration instance will support only email with that suffix.

### Authentication&#x20;
