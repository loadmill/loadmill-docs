# Steps

Steps are the core components of flows, made up of one or more steps of varying types. They generate, process, and share data. In the code editor, steps can be copied, created, edited, and deleted.

#### Steps views

There are two views in the flow editor.&#x20;

1.  Summary View: Displays a scrollable area containing all the steps, with each step collapsed to show summarized details.\

2. Expanded view: Displays single steps at a time expanded with all the available functionality.\
   note, some function will require additional expansion.

{% hint style="info" %}
Navigating between steps in Expended view can be done by keyboard up/down keys and by clicking on the step name on the left index list (when available on wide views).
{% endhint %}

**Switching between the views** can be dome by clicking on the title area of a step in non active areas as illustrated below
