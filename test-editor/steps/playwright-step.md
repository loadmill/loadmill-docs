# Playwright step

The **Playwright step** allows you to run UI automation scripts using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as part of your Loadmill flow.

This is especially useful when validating UI behavior alongside your API steps ‚Äî for example, logging in through the UI, verifying elements on the page, or simulating full end-user workflows.

## Usage

The Playwright step contains a single **code editor** where you write your Playwright script.


> üß† Only write the contents of a `test()` block ‚Äî do **not** include the test declaration itself.

‚úÖ **Correct:**

```ts
await page.goto('https://www.loadmill.com');
await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Loadmill/);
await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email' }).fill(email);
```

‚ùå **Incorrect:**

```ts
test('Login test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://www.loadmill.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Loadmill/);
  await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email' }).fill(email);
});
```

## Parameters and context

In the Playwright step, **all suite and flow parameters** are available directly as variables ‚Äî no need to use `${param}` syntax like in other inputs.

‚úÖ **Correct:**

```ts
await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email' }).fill(email);
```

‚ùå **Incorrect:**
```ts
await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email' }).fill(${email});
```

## Cookies

Session cookies are passed automatically into the Playwright browser context, so you can stay authenticated between API and UI steps.

To manually set cookies, you can use Playwright‚Äôs built-in [`context.addCookies`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-add-cookies) method:

```ts
await context.addCookies([
  {
    name: 'my_cookie',
    value: '12345',
    domain: 'your-app.com',
    path: '/',
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: true,
    sameSite: 'Lax',
  },
]);
```

## Attaching screenshots to the report

You can attach screenshots directly to your test report using Playwright‚Äôs `testInfo.attach` method.

‚úÖ Example:

```ts
await page.goto('https://loadmill.com');

const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
testInfo.attach('Loadmill Page', {
  body: screenshot,
  contentType: 'image/png',
});
```

## Requirements

To use Playwright steps, a [private agent](https://docs.loadmill.com/integrations/testing-localhost-application) with UI tests enabled is required.

You can enable UI testing using one of the following options:

- **Desktop App** - UI testing is supported out of the box with no additional configuration required.

- **Docker** - Set the following environment variable when running the container:

  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm -e LOADMILL_AGENT_TOKEN=<your-api-token> -e UI_TESTS_ENABLED=true loadmill/agent
  ```

- **NPM Package** - Run the agent with the `--ui-tests` flag:

  ```bash
  loadmill-agent start -t INSERT_TOKEN_HERE --ui-tests
  ```

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è This option requires additional dependencies and lacks the isolation benefits of Docker or the Desktop app.
