The code steps allows running JavaScript code snippets at any point without spinning an entire request. Among it's usages are introducing initialization logic at first step of a flow, processing specific data right after a generic shared flow, and providing more visibility and clarity in flows and it's special logic steps.

The code step consists of two areas:

1. Code editor - a place to write your JavaScript snippets
2. Flow control - Allows skipping to another step, stopping the flow and add wait time after step execution.
