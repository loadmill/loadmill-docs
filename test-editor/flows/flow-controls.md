# Flow Controls

Flows provides additional features and functions that can be found in the top right corner of the editor.

### Debug Mode&#x20;

Working on a flow often requires checking or verifying certain things during execution. For example, if the flow involves adding then removing an item from an online shopping cart, we might want to verify that the item was indeed added to the cart during the execution.

Loadmill provides the functionality to execute tests in debug mode. When the debug toggle (![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (158).png>)) is turned on (![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (159).png>)), a small checkbox will appear next to each request in the flow, allowing you to set a request as the breakpoint for debugging. Once the flow is executed, the test will be paused right before the checked request is made. The results window will already show the statuses of completed requests, with a 'pending' status indicating the upcoming request, which serves as the breakpoint.

#### Export Flow

Exports the current flow you're viewing (in `.yaml`).

#### Duplicate Flow

Duplicates the current flow on your Test Suite.

#### Convert to Load Test

Coverts the current flow into a Load Test. See here how to setup Load testing with Loadmill.

#### Replace Parameters

Replaces the given parameter generated by Loadmill or by the user to a new parameter name.

**ex:** Loadmill uses `${origin_`_`1}` to define the base url of the test._ By applying Replace Parameters you can replace `${origin1}` to `${base_url}`.

{% hint style="info" %}
This only changes the name of the parameter without affecting its value.
{% endhint %}

#### Extract Parameter

Extracts a given value from the Test Flow into a parameter.

**ex:** Say you have a unique value that you want to parameterize like a visitor id, a specific name or even a phone number. You can extract those values and parameterize them by applying the Extract Parameter tool.

{% hint style="info" %}
All parameterized values are located in the PARAMETERS tab of the suite.
{% endhint %}

#### Copy Flow To Suite

Copies the current flow to the chosen suite.

#### Suggest Failure

Once a flow is executed and fails, this button will appear ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>) which, using AI, provides you with a possible reason and solution for the test, according to the tests agenda. For example:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>In this example, it seems like one of the request used the wrong method</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Fix It For Me

As AI suggests whats wrong with the test, and gives a possible way to solve it, why wouldn't it just solve it by itself?\
The 'FIX IT FOR ME' button, leads to the edit-using-AI panel prompt prefilled with the suggestion AI provided before.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then it acts like the regular 'Edit Using AI' feature explained [here](https://docs.loadmill.com/test-editor/flows/test-flow-editor#the-test-flow-toolbar).
