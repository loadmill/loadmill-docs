# What is an API endpoint?

An API endpoint is a specific URL that your application can access to retrieve data or perform an action. Each endpoint is designed to perform a specific task, such as retrieving data from a database or adding new data to a database.&#x20;

API endpoints are typically defined by the functionality they provide, such as retrieving all users from a database or creating a new user. However, endpoints can also be defined by their formats, such as JSON, XML, or HTML.

When you make a request to an API endpoint, the server will respond with the data you requested or the results of the action you performed. The format of the response will be determined by the format of the endpoint (JSON, XML, or HTML).
