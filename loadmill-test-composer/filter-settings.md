# Filter Settings

You can adjust your filter settings to allow you to personalize the API test.

#### **Include Domains**

"Include Domains" lets you register API calls from outside of the current domain. You'll find it useful when registering API flows that require external domains for authentication, purchase flows**,** etc.

#### Filter Containing Strings

The filter will remove strings containing any input given (such as ".js", “.img”,”css”, etc..) so that the URLs for these strings don't affect your API flow. This is an essential process for ensuring that your test is composed reliably.
