# Groups & Reports

Loadmill provides functionality for creating logical groups. Groups serve as a mechanism for teams to take ownership of test suites and flows. They allow for the segmentation of reports based on performance and facilitate understanding of ownership within different groups. Being part of a group makes it easier to avoid confusion about test responsibilities and enables better focus on owned areas.

Here is a group creation example:

### Assigning Tests to Groups

You can assign your Flows/Suites to groups. To do so, navigate to the desired flow/suite, and click on the 'Assign group' button located at the top (![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (177).png>)), then choose the group you want to assign the test to.&#x20;

> Assigning a suite to a group takes precedence over assigning a group to a flow. For example, if group X is assigned to a suite, and group Y to a flow inside the suite, the test will be counted as belonging to group X.

### Reports Dashboards

Viewing group-filtered reports is convenient. Simply navigate to Reports -&#x20;

Where you can filter the displayed statistics for a specific group within the available options.
