# Reviews

"Teamwork makes the dream work." - John C. Maxwell. A team that works collaboratively on a suite can review each other's tests and make the best out of it. Inside COLLABORATION -> Reviews, a new review request can be created. A review allows to discuss and suggest changes in a suite or specific flows.

After adding a review:

Once a review is created, the team members added as reviewers are notified and have access to comment on it.

Comments are written in markdown format.

They can be added generally in the review (![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (178).png>))

and/or in a specific flow under 'FLOWS', e.g.:

Under Flows, the reviewed flows can also be added/removed.

In 'SETTINGS', every user can modify the reviewers list and enable/disable email notifications.&#x20;
