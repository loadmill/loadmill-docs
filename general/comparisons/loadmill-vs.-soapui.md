# Loadmill vs. SoapUI

While SoapUI is well-known for its functional API testing capabilities, particularly with SOAP and REST protocols, Loadmill provides a more advanced, AI-driven platform focused on end-to-end API testing and system integration. Loadmill’s ease of use for less technical users, AI-powered automation for test creation and maintenance, and seamless integration with SDLC tools make it a better choice for enterprises looking for comprehensive testing solutions. Additionally, Loadmill's deployment flexibility, robust support, and stability offer enterprises a lower-risk, more efficient solution for complex testing environments compared to SoapUI's more limited functionality.
