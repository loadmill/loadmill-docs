# Test Coverage

During [test plan](../../../general/api-testing1/test-plan.md) execution, Loadmill generates comprehensive test coverage reports. These reports provide insights into the specific plan run, including the number of APIs covered. Users can also select multiple services to view test coverage for each service within a single plan, enhancing overall testing efficiency. Loadmill allows users to specify the service for API mapping during test plan execution. This feature ensures accurate representation of APIs within different service environments, facilitating targeted testing efforts.
