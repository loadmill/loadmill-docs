# gRPC Support

Loadmill supports gRPC-based testing. You can easily create gRPC test flows and validate your services in the same streamlined process as with other protocols.

### **Usage**

To execute a gRPC request:

* Go to the relevant test flow within your Test Suite.
* Set the Request URL using `grpc://<dns>` (replace `<dns>` with your target serviceâ€™s DNS). Typing `grpc://` will automatically adjust the request settings for gRPC usage.
* Once the gRPC protocol is detected, Loadmill will automatically extract and offer gRPC method options based on the uploaded `.proto` files.

### Uploading service definitions (.proto files)

Loadmill automatically offers the available gRPC methods after recognizing the gRPC protocol and parsing your `.proto` files.&#x20;

Go to Service Definitions section:

Inside, create a new Service Definition, and upload your `.proto` file/s.

The service definitions will be parsed, and method names will be extracted.&#x20;

To configure service definitions for use in your flow:

* Click on the three dots on the top right
* Choose "Configure Service Definition"
* Pair your Service Definition to your Test Flow

Once the service is paired, the methods will be automatically offered within the flow editor.&#x20;
